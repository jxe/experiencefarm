Pairings
	- TEST: "Me too!" button on notices from another person

Soon
	- fix topbar layout to look like Ratchet / ios7
	- truck playheads together
	- Truck Genre playlists together for friends who are close and want to
	- "You can't play this, it's too far away"

Later
	- gear menu for playing a song that's too far away, etc
	- infinite scrolling for feed page... just loads 100 initially
	- use song duration not sound duration
	- loading indicator after you load a genre
	- FIX: beeps on new action from me, after new action from other player
