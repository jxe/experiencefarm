LATER
- bring "delete" back, but hidden behind a little gear
- "fast forward" appears only if there's no actions and no placelabel


- "explore further" (replace "seen" w. "events")
- google places autocomplete
- redesign "me too" and "explore further" etc, w. button flow


Soundprints
- DESIGN: a notion of presence
	* (5m) confirm rewind when group room
- "One other person is ready to record/play with you."
- Read about firebase presence

- DESIGN: redesign "me too" placement, confirm (sound! scroll!), and data model

- BUGFIX-1: try just throwing away document clicks if we've wired up tap?

====================

- "Where are you?" prompt much bigger and bolder... modal?
- Google places integration

====================

- BUGFIX-2: can we just block attempts to blur for 5s after an input autofocus?

====================

- BUG: Keyboard focus bug after selecting a tab

- after "me too": "Let's explore?"

- truck playheads together

- capstone
	- at the end: "invite other users" or "keep private"
	- "add a capstone photo"
		- Ideas:
			- make a facial expression that goes with this soundtrack
			- take a photo of your hat, shoes, etc



FIX LATER


- fourth tab: "I suggest"
	- buttons are "okay", "no thanks"

- with "i will": "good luck"
	- seen, and done
	- "me too!" or "Good luck!"

- Prompt of the Week: Make one to a song, in a kind of venue, or with a certain kinds of noticing, doing, fitness, etc.
- First page includes prompts and soundtracks?
	- Prompt
	- Number of responses / soundtracks recorded 
		- in which cities
- leave a sticker - sparkly play button



* ON THE BUS / TRAIN: playhead sync! - rewind/play/pause affects both players
   * On play set value that starts countdown
   * Start countdown fn that takes loc and date time and div to put countdown in
   * On pause, set seek loc, same w rewind
   * Player#pause_at(t0)

Soon
	- truck playheads together
	- Truck Genre playlists together for friends who are close and want to
	- "You can't play this, it's too far away"

Later
	- gear menu for playing a song that's too far away, etc
	- infinite scrolling for feed page... just loads 100 initially
	- use song duration not sound duration
	- loading indicator after you load a genre
	- FIX: beeps on new action from me, after new action from other player
