Pairings

* ON THE BUS / TRAIN: playhead sync! - rewind/play/pause affects both players
   * On play set value that starts countdown
   * Start countdown fn that takes loc and date time and div to put countdown in
   * On pause, set seek loc, same w rewind
   * Player#pause_at(t0)
   * Player#stream(start_time, t0, indicator, track)
   * (20m) confirm rewind
   
Soon
	- fix topbar layout to look like Ratchet / ios7
	- truck playheads together
	- Truck Genre playlists together for friends who are close and want to
	- "You can't play this, it's too far away"

Later
	- gear menu for playing a song that's too far away, etc
	- infinite scrolling for feed page... just loads 100 initially
	- use song duration not sound duration
	- loading indicator after you load a genre
	- FIX: beeps on new action from me, after new action from other player
